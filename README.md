## Overview
This project consisted on creating a pitch for a citi bikesharing business proposal for investors looking to seed fund. The goal was to look at citi bike data in New York City on the month of august to look how this bikesharing business operates in its prime during summer. 

## Results

This presentation was based on New York City but could be applied to other cities as necessary. 

- During august, the most profitable month of the year, the most popular hours in which people used the bikes were 5 and 6 pm during the afternoon and 8 am during the morning. Most likely related to commutes to/from work and/or school.

- This heatmap supports displays how the most heated and popular times are 8am and 5-6 pm during workdays. It provides additional information such as that thursday is the most popular day of the week, and that saturday and sundays' afternoons are also very popular for bikesharing.

As it can be seen in the *User Trips Dashboard*, almost 80% of the users are subscribers, meanwhile the others are just customers who sometimes use the bikes. More specifically, male subscribers are the most popular users followed by female subscribers. There are also many customers who happen to avoid the gender selection, so they appear as unknown gender. I suggest they should try to engage more customers as a whole.

As it can be seen, all genders usually use the bikes for 5 minutes approximately. After 5 minutes, the trip durations start to slope down. Almost nobody uses the bikes after 45 minutes, where the slope starts to decline significantly.

(Update Photo and Analysis)

In this gender breakdown we see the majority of customers are male, then women, and finally unknown gender. They all happen to have similar behavior on using bikes at the same times.

And last but not least, we can see NYC's start and end trip spread. Even though this is the map for New York City, we can expect a similar behavior in other cities. There is always a more populated area (in this case Manhattan), where the majority of the bikes would be used. But in general, we can expect a very spread out utilization with wide coverage.

(ADDED Photo and Analysis)
In further analysis of the data, I calacuated the rides by user. The majority of the users are betwwen 18 to 32 years old, which makes sense as this demographis tends to be more physically active and in need of more afforable transportations options. There is a outlier at 52 years old for 'unknown' gender with over 200,000 rides, which would require further analysis to see how this affects the over all data.

##Summary
In general, I think bikisharing companys will benefit in cities due to larger commuting populations and, more often, a large population of young studesn/up-comming work force needing cheaper transportations with high cost of living/transportation costs.
