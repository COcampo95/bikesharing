# bikesharing


## Overview
This project consisted on creating a pitch for a citi bikesharing business proposal for investors looking to seed fund. The goal was to look at citi bike data in New York City on the month of august to look how this bikesharing business operates in its prime during summer. 

## Results

This presentation was based on New York City but could be applied to other cities as necessary. 

- During august, the most profitable month of the year, the most popular hours in which people used the bikes were 5 and 6 pm during the afternoon and 8 am during the morning. Most likely related to commutes to/from work and/or school.

- This heatmap supports displays how the most heated and popular times are 8am and 5-6 pm during workdays. It provides additional information such as that thursday is the most popular day of the week, and that saturday and sundays' afternoons are also very popular for bikesharing.

As it can be seen in the *User Trips Dashboard*, in the upper left, almost 80% of the users are subscribers, meanwhile the others are just customers who sometimes use the bikes. More specifically, male subscribers are the most popular users followed by female subscribers. There are also many customers who happen to avoid the gender selection, so they appear as unknown gender. I suggest they should try to engage more customers as a whole.

And last but not least, we can see NYC's start and end trip spread. Even though this is the map for New York City, we can expect a similar behavior in other cities. There is always a more populated area (in this case Manhattan), where the majority of the bikes would be used. But in general, we can expect a very spread out utilization with wide coverage.
